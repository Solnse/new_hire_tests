## Modus Programmer Challenges
Contained in the directories below this README are coding challenges for the prospective Modus Ruby developer. Your goal should be to complete as many as possible and you should _attempt_ all of them.

Include comments in your code to explain your thinking, and don't be afraid to experiment. A half answer, or even an incorrect or incomplete implementation will be viewed more positively than no attempt.
