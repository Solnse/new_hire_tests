## Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
Write a Ruby program that challenges the user to a game of [RPSLS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock). The program should work by asking for the user to make one of the 5 possible choices, then randomly selecting one of the 5 for the computer player. The program should keep track of score and allow the player to quit at any time.
