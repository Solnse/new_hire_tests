## Fibonacci Generator
Write a program in Ruby that prints the [Fibonacci numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) up to a user-provided upper-bound. The sequence should begin with the number 1.  For instance, for a user input of 300, the correct Fibonacci sequence would be:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233
